This project details a side-scrolling, asteroid-dodging space game, where the goal is to continually travel right and avoid the debris flying at you for as long as possible. Score is tracked across multiple users, and the global best score is also tracked and displayed. Additional features include difficulty increment, a user-adjustable game timer, and LED display animations.
